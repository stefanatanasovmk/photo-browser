# Photo Browser

This app is built as a coding task for Geniem.

If you want to run this app locally, you will need to have installed Node v.~ 16.13.2 and Typescript v.~8.1.2 (this are the versions that I'm using on my local machine)

## Run the project locally in development mode:

### `git clone https://github.com/stefanatanasovmk/photo-browser.git`

Cd into the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Run the project locally in production mode:

### `git clone https://github.com/stefanatanasovmk/photo-browser.git`

In the project directory, execute these commands:

### `npm install`

### `npm install serve`

### `npm run build`

### `serve build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, and if everything goes right, you will be able to see the app if you open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.\

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
