# Photo Browser

This app is built as a coding task for Geniem.

You will need to have installed Node v.~ 16.13.2 and Typescript v.~8.1.2 (this are the versions that I'm using on my local machine)

## Run the project locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
